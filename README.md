# üåç WanderWise

WanderWise is a simple travel-oriented application that allows users to keep track of tourist places they‚Äôve already visited. The destinations are pre-selected and personally curated to create a unique and meaningful experience.

The project is divided into two main parts:

<ul>
  <li>backend-json: Handles data and image serving using Express.js and JSON files.</li>
  <li>frontend-mock: A frontend-only version using React with mocked data, simulating real interactions without needing a server.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

## ‚ú® Recursos

- Select from a list of tourist spots
- Mark places as visited
- View your personal collection
- Two separate versions of the app:
  - Full version with backend support
  - Mock version for quick testing or demo
